VOD reviewing is one of the fastest ways to get better at fighting. It’s not just about watching your games; it’s about actively removing mistakes from your gameplay to become a smarter fighter. Top pros like Vadil went from zero earnings to becoming one of the scariest fighters in EU by using this exact method. Let's break down how you can do it too.

## The Simple Strategy: Play, Watch, Analyze

The core concept is simple: play one to two hours of solo ranked, then immediately go into the replay tool and watch your games back. But the value comes from knowing *what* to look for. Here’s a breakdown of a real fight to show you the process.

### Step 1: Identify and Analyze Your Peeks

In a recent fight, I eliminated a player and felt I played it well. I took my time, reloaded, and hit some good shots. In the moment, it feels like a clean kill. However, the replay tool reveals a critical mistake.

> By watching from my opponent's point of view (POV), I saw that even though they weren't a great player, I gave them a free shot. I performed a wide-open, unprotected peek, which allowed them to hit me for 88 damage.

* **The Mistake:** An overly aggressive, wide peek that exposed me to unnecessary damage.
* **The Fix:** I should have used a protected right-hand peek or a smaller window edit. This would have allowed me to deal damage while remaining completely safe. Against a better player, this mistake could have cost me the fight.

### Step 2: Reinforce Good Habits

VOD reviewing isn't just about finding mistakes; it's also about recognizing and reinforcing what you do correctly. This helps build good habits.

In another engagement, my opponent made space to go for a counter-shot. Instead of trying to replace their wall or force an edit play, I anticipated their move, held my ground, and took an advantageous trade shot since I knew I had an HP advantage. This was a smart, patient play.

* **The Good Play:** Anticipating the enemy's counter-peek and opting for a simple, effective trade instead of a risky play.
* **The Takeaway:** Make a mental note of these successful plays. Recognizing your smart decisions helps you repeat them in future games.

## The Most Crucial Part: Analyze Your Deaths

The most significant improvement comes from breaking down the fights where you die. In a fight against a decent player—the kind you’ll face in cash cups—I made a series of small mistakes that compounded and led to my elimination.

### A Breakdown of the 5 Key Mistakes

* **Poor Initial Beam:** I tried to get a beam while moving in water, resulting in only 32 damage. A moment of patience to get set would have given me a much bigger advantage.
* **Improper High-Ground Setup:** I gained high ground but didn't set up my peak correctly. When I opened the floor for a shot, the opponent easily placed a wall to block it. I needed to control more pieces before exposing myself.
* **Wrong Angle of Pressure:** I pressured the long side of my opponent's 2x1 box. This gave them plenty of room to back up and counter-peek. The correct play is to pressure the short side, limiting their movement options.
* **Committing to a 50/50:** My worst habit. I tried to end the fight quickly by dashing into the box with my AR out. The opponent simply held their shotgun and hit a massive counter-pump. Never force a 50/50 when you can play smarter.
* **Expecting Your Opponent to Play Passively:** This was the final nail in the coffin. After trading, we were both one HP. I expected them to heal, so I started reloading in a single, unprotected box. Instead, they aggressed immediately, took my wall, and finished me.

### Step 3: Create an Action Plan

Watching the VOD is only half the battle. You need to act on what you find. For every session, you should:

* **Write Down Your Mistakes:** Use a Google Doc or a Discord channel to list every mistake that led to a death. Be specific. Instead of "bad peek," write "wide left-hand peek exposed me."
* **Focus on Fixing Them:** For the next week, your goal isn't just to win but to consciously avoid the mistakes you wrote down.
* **Don't Get Overwhelmed:** Focus on fixing one or two major recurring issues at a time. Trying to change everything at once is a recipe for failure.

By consistently eliminating the small mistakes that get you killed, your fighting IQ and damage ratios will improve dramatically. That is the entire goal of fighting: to win engagements cleanly and consistently.
